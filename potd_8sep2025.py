Merge Sort for Linked List
You are given the head of a linked list. You have to sort the given linked list using Merge Sort.

Examples:
Input:    
Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60
Explanation: After sorting the given linked list, the resultant list will be:
    
Input:    
Output: 2 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9
Explanation: After sorting the given linked list, the resultant list will be:
    
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 106

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)"""
